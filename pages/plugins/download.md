## The Eclipse package way

The simplest way is to download **Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers** from [Eclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/downloads/) and you get at once both Eclipse CDT and the Embedded CDT plug-ins.

## The Eclipse Marketplace way

The second option is to use the
[Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-embedded-cdt/).

To access the Marketplace from within Eclipse, use the Eclipse menu
**Help** â†’ **Eclipse marketplace...** and search for *Embedded CDT*.

## The Eclipse plug-ins way

Installing Eclipse usually does not require to separately download any
binary, since Eclipse provides a special mechanism to install and
update plug-ins.

Starting with v5.1.1, the update site URL was migrated to Eclipse

`https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/updates/neon/`

> Java 11 notice: Starting with 2020, Eclipse requires Java 11; trying to
update the plug-ins while using Java 8 is unsuccessful, sometimes
without any message or warning.

More details are available in the [Install](/plugins/install/) page.

### Pre-release versions

For previews, test releases are posted to a separate update site:

`https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/updates/neon-test/`

Usually this site should be safe to use, but use it with caution.

### Experimental versions

For previews, experimental releases are posted to a separate update site:

`https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/builds/develop/p2/`

Sometimes you can use this site to test some features that are not
completely implemented, or that might change before a final version is released.

This site is not always updated; use it carefully, back up your workspace,
and do not use it for production projects.

## The local archive way

If, for any reasons, you need to revert to a specific version, or the
Eclipse mechanism to install new software fails,  you can always download
the desired version and manually install the plug-ins from the local archive.

Starting with **v5.1.1**, releases were published on the
[Eclipse servers](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/governance/).

All versions prior to **v5.1.1** will continue to be available as
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/releases/).

Navigate to the desired version and download the attached archive, it should be a **zip** file with a long name like:

`ilg.gnumcueclipse.repository-5.1.1-202007271621.zip`

Please note that not all plug-in versions run on all Eclipse versions,
and usually new plug-in versions may require new Eclipse versions,
so better try to stay as up-to-date with the Eclipse as possible.
(For Eclipse Luna 4.4 and later, use versions 3.x; for Eclipse Kepler 4.3,
use versions 2.x; for older Eclipses, try the final 0.5.5 version, but
keep in mind it is no longer maintained).
