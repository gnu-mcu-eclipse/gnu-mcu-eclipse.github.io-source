## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the QEMU binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/](https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

## Why QEMU?

Adding emulator support to GNU MCU Eclipse took quite some time to materialise. By the end of 2014 the decision was made to use [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page), the long-standing open-source multi-platform emulator. It is mature, it provides a good framework for emulation, it implements a GDB server, it provides support for semihosting, and although it does not intend to accurately simulate processor time behaviour, it does keep a quite accurate track of time when emulating timer interrupts, so it can also be used to emulate applications using RTOS-es.

## Why GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU?

QEMU is a great project, but its original focus was to emulate boards with large cores, usually application class, able to run Unix/Linux kernels. Support for bare metal Cortex-M based boards was available only for a very limited range of Cortex-M3 cores, so of little use in GNU MCU Eclipse.

Even more, support for semihosting in the public QEMU version was broken, and the verbosity required for integration with the QEMU plug-in was missing, so it could not be used with the GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins.

## Overview

The **GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU** is a fork of the public open-source [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) project, customised for more support of Cortex-M cores, and a better integration with the **GNU ARM QEMU Debugging** plug-in.

## Benefits

The main benefits of using the **GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU** are:

* users can run the **blinky** projects generated by the GNU MCU Eclipse templates immediately, without any specific hardware, neither development board nor JTAG programmer; all debugging features, like single stepping, inspecting variables, registers, etc. are supported.
* the emulator provides a very convenient platform for running **unit tests**, fully supporting the **semihosting** features required for this.

## Supported boards and MCUs

### Compatibility & peripherals

The GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU maintains a certain degree of compatibility with the original **qemu-system-arm**, but it does not include the large ARM cores, being focused only on Cortex-M cores.

The main compatibility requirement for the emulator was to support all devices addressed during the standard CMSIS initialisations, which generally refer to PLL & clock settings.

The next requirement was to fully support the GPIOs, at the level of allowing one or more LEDs to blink.

### SysTick

The **blinky** projects generated by the GNU MCU Eclipse templates (and all STM32 HAL projects) use the SysTick to measure time, so any realistic emulation should support SysTick. GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU not only does this, but also provides relatively accurate time intervals, and the SysTick exception can be used from simple time measuring to driving a real-time scheduler with a reasonable number of task switches per second (1000 Hz is OK).

## Limitations

* QEMU accurately emulates Cortex-M3 and M4 thumb instructions; specific Cortex-M4 floating point instructions are not supported;
* the current implementation of NVIC uses some related interrupt controller code from larger cores, and is not very accurate.

## Documentation

The official QEMU documentation is available in two manuals:

* QEMU Emulator – User Documentation,
* QEMU Internals
both located in the doc folder in the install location. The official QEMU site also has a page with various links to [QEMU manuals](http://wiki.qemu.org/Manual).

All provide a lot of information about QEMU, but do not go into much detail related to Cortex-M.

## Download

All **GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU** versions are available from the GitHub [QEMU Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/releases) page. Identify the **Latest release** entry and carefully read the release page.

## Install

The details of installing the **GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU** on various platforms are presented in a dedicated [Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu/install) page.

## Testing

The recommended method to test QEMU is using the new QEMU Debugging plug-in; create a test project using the [blinky]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/blinky-arm/) **STM32F4xx C/C++ Project** template or even the **Hello World ARM Cortex-M C/C++ Project** template and run it as explained in the [QEMU debugging Eclipse plug-in]({{ site.baseurl }}/debug/qemu/) page.

## Future development

After the initial version proved that the idea to define peripheral register via tables is functional, it became obvious that these tables are not for humans to generate, but for machines. These definitions, in one way or another, are already available from the ARM SVD files (very large XMLs). So, for the use of QEMU, the next step is to process the SVD files and generate JSON files, with the peripheral registers, exactly as needed for a fast load by the emulator at startup. Then, from the JSON files, the run-time peripheral register objects can be generated.

There is currently no ETA for these changes, but if anyone is interested to support development, priorities might be changed.

## Updates

As a fork of the public open source project QEMU, it is planned that the **GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU** will follow the releases of QEMU and also follow the GNU MCU Eclipse release schedule, for the specific features.

## Change log

The change log is available as a separate [Change log]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu/change-log) page.

## Build details

For those interested on the procedure used to build these packages, please read the [How to build]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu/build-procedure) page. However, the ultimate source for details are the build scripts themselves, all available from the [build-scripts Git](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/build-scripts/tree/master/scripts).

## Releases
