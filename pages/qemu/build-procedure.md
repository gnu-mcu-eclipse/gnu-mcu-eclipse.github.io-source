## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the QEMU binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/](https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.
___

The **GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU** build scripts provide a single tool to create 
multi-platform binaries, generating the **Windows 32**, **Windows 64**, 
**GNU/Linux 32**, **GNU/Linux 64** and **macOS** distribution packages.

The script was developed on macOS, but it also runs on any recent 
GNU/Linux distribution.

## How to build?

For the final authoritative details, please refer to the separate 
[qemu-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu-build/) project.
