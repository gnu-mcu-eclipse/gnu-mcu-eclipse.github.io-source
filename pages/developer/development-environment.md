## Liviu Ionescu's build environment

I'm currently using macOS 10.14.x running on a Mac mini 2018, with 32 GB of
RAM and 1 TB of SSD. The debugging sessions are started from within Eclipse
on macOS. I currently have limited debug capabilities on other platforms
(sorry for this).

For testing the resulting plug-ins binaries on other platforms, I install
them on Eclipses within several virtual machines running on
Oracle VirtualBox:

- Ubuntu Desktop 18.x, 64-bit
- Xubuntu Desktop 18.x, 32-bit
- Windows 10, 64-bit
- Windows 10, 32-bit
