## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the OpenOCD binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/openocd/](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

___

The OpenOCD binaries are published on GitHub  [Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/releases).

The procedure used to publish those binaries is documented on the [PUBLISH](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/blob/gnu-mcu-eclipse-dev/PUBLISH.md) page in the same project.
