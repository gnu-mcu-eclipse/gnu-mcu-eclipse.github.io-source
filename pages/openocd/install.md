## Overview

[OpenOCD](http://openocd.org) is an open source project hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/), and project maintainers insist that all end-users should compile it from the latest version of the source code available from their repository. There are no special stable branches or tags and there are no clear release dates for future versions. On Windows you need to install MSYS2 and use the appropriate package build procedure.

If you are not interested in building from sources, and appreciate a better integration with the Eclipse plug-in, please feel free to use the GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD binaries, and preferably install them in the default locations.

**Warning:** OpenOCD is a very complex project, capable of working with many JTAG probes, but support for them must be explicitly included at build time, so be sure that support for your JTAG probe was included in the binaries you plan to use. The **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** includes support for most existing probes.

## J-Link conversion

If the only reason to run OpenOCD is to use the ST-LINK on-board programmer on STM Discovery or Nucleo boards, then, thanks to SEGGER, a better solution exists: it is possible to **upgrade the on-board programmer firmware to behave like a J-Link** lite, and then use the GNU MCU Eclipse J-Link plug-in. The conversion is reversible, you can return the board to ST-LINK at any time.

Please follow the instructions on [Converting ST-LINK on-board into a J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/st-link-on-board/).


## The xPack install 

This method uses the portable tool [xpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm), the **xPack Package Manager**, and can be used on Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux.

```console
$ xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd
```

This will always install the latest available version, in the central xPacks repository, which is a platform dependent folder:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%\xPacks` (like `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\xPacks`)
* macOS: `${HOME}/Library/xPacks`
* GNU/Linux: `${HOME}/opt/xPacks`

Note: This location is configurable using the environment variable `XPACKS_REPO_FOLDER`; for more details please check the [xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/files/folders/) page.

> Windows antivirus warning: aggressive antiviruses may prevent
  xpm to install binary xPacks; see [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/)

## Manual install

The all platforms, **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** is released as a portable archive that can be installed in any location.

The archives can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/releases) page.

### Windows

The Windows versions of **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** are packed as ZIP files. Download the latest version named like:

- `gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-6-20180112-1448-win64.zip`
- `gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-6-20180112-1448-win32.zip`

Select the `-win64` file for Windows x64 machines and the `-win32` file for Windows x32 machines.

Unpack the archive and copy it into the `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\GNU MCU Eclipse` (for example `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\GNU MCU Eclipse`) folder; according to Microsoft, this is the recommended location for installing user specific packages;

> Note: although perfectly possible to install OpenOCD in any folder, it is highly recommended to use this path, since by default the plug-in searches for the executable in this location.

The result is a structure like:

![The OpenOCD folders structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/windows-folders-openocd.png)

To check if OpenOCD starts, use the following command:

```console
C:>"C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\GNU MCU Eclipse\OpenOCD\0.10.0-5-20171110-1117\bin\openocd" --version
GNU MCU Eclipse 64-bit Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0+dev-00254-g2ec04e4e (2017-11-10-13:20)
```

#### Drivers

As usual on Windows, mastering drivers is a challenge and OpenOCD is no exceptions, so don't be surprised to encounter many incompatible drivers for various JTAG probes. The OpenOCD distribution includes some libusb drivers, and recommends to run the `zadig.exe` tool to activate them. Although this manoeuvre will make OpenOCD happy, it will most probably ruin other USB drivers you might have installed. Our strong recommendation is to **NOT** do this, and instead use the manufacturer drivers, when compatible with OpenOCD.

##### ST-LINK/V2

One example of compatible drivers are the ST-LINK/V2 USB drivers, from ST, available as part number [STSW-LINK009](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/FM147/SC1887/PF260219). Download the `stsw-link009.zip` archive, extract its content to a separate folder, and run the `dpinst_amd64.exe` (or `dpinst_x86.exe`) with administrative privileges.

As for most Windows drivers, to complete the installation, a restart usually helps.

Connect the ST-LINK/v2 or the DISCOVERY board and check in **Control Panel** → **System** → **Device Manager** if the JTAG is operational.

![ST-LINK Windows device]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/windows-devices-stlink.png)

For other probes follow the manufacturer instructions.

Note 1: All Windows tests were performed on Windows 10. If, for any reasons, you still use older versions, especially the venerable Windows XP, some differences may be observed in the USB subsystem; to stay on the safe side, try to always use original manufacturer drivers.

Note 2: OpenOCD v0.7.0 does not work with the current J-Link drivers, so on Windows it is not possible to use OpenOCD with J-Link; use the SEGGER supplied software instead.

##### Zadig

For some devices, for example [ARM-USB-OCD](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/) from [Olimex](https://www.olimex.com/), after installing the vendor drivers, you must also install Zadig and convert the vendor drivers to WinUSB drivers.

### macOS

The macOS version of **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** is packed as a TGZ archive. Download the latest version named like:

-  `gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-6-20180112-1448-osx.tgz`

To install OpenOCD, unpack the archive and copy it to  `/${HOME}/opt/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/`:

```console
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/opt
$ cd ${HOME}/opt
$ tar xvf ~/Downloads/gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-5-20171110-1117-osx.tgz
$ chmod -R -w gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.10.0-5-20171110-1117
```

> Note: although perfectly possible to install OpenOCD in any folder, it is highly recommended to use this path, since by default the plug-in searches for the executable in this location.

To check if OpenOCD starts, use:

```console
$ ${HOME}/opt/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.10.0-5-20171110-1117/bin/openocd --version
GNU MCU Eclipse 64-bit Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0+dev-00254-g2ec04e4e (2017-11-10-13:20)
```

### GNU/Linux

The GNU/Linux versions of **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** are packed as TGZ archives. Download the latest version named like:

- `gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-6-20180112-1448-centos64.tgz`
- `gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-6-20180112-1448-centos32.tgz`

As the name implies, these are CentOS `tar.gz` archives, but can be executed on most recent GNU/Linux distributions (they were tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Manjaro, SuSE and Fedora). Select the `-centos64` file for 64-bit machines and the `-centos32` file for 32-bit machines.

To install OpenOCD, unpack the archive and copy it to  `/${HOME}/opt/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/${version}`:

```console
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/opt
$ cd ${HOME}/opt
$ tar xvf ~/Downloads/gnu-mcu-eclipse-openocd-0.10.0-5-20171110-1117-debian64.tgz
$ chmod -R -w gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.10.0-5-20171110-1117
```

> Note: although perfectly possible to install OpenOCD in any folder, it is highly recommended to use this path, since by default the plug-in searches for the executable in this location.

To check if OpenOCD starts and is recent, use:

```console
$ ${HOME}/opt/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.10.0-5-20171110-1117/bin/openocd --version
GNU MCU Eclipse 64-bit Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0+dev-00254-g2ec04e4e (2017-11-10-13:20)
```

#### UDEV

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them), the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the **UDEV** subsystem. OpenOCD provides an UDEV rules file defining all the supported IDs; to install it, just copy the file to `/etc/udev/rules.d` and eventually notify the daemon:

```console
$ sudo cp ${HOME}/opt/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.10.0-5-20171110-1117/contrib/99-openocd.rules \
  /etc/udev/rules.d/
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Note: If you previously installed the J-Link binaries, the USB IDs were already added to UDEV. The above OpenOCD rules file also defines the J-Link ID. Apparently UDEV does not complain; if you encounter problems, just comment out the definition in the OpenOCD file.

#### USB access rights

On some GNU/Linux distributions, the UDEV definitions are not enough,
or are not effective, and when trying to access the JTAG probe,
an error is issued:

```console
libusb_open failed: LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS
```

If this happens, first try to start openocd with sudo; if this works,
for regular work you also need to grant your user permission to use the USB.

For example, on Ubuntu 15.10 you need to issue something like:

```console
$ sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
```

Then restart and login again.

If you still have problems, check your distribution documentation and
when you have a functional solution post it on the project forum.

## Testing

To test if OpenOCD is able to connect to a specific board, you generally need to select the interface and the processor. As a shortcut, for some well known boards, there are ready made configuration files to set both the interface and the processor. For example, on macOS, to test a connection via ST/LINK v2 to the STM32F4DISCOERY board, you can use the sample below:

```console
$ ${HOME}/opt/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.8.0-201501181257/bin/openocd \
  -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg

## OpenOCD Debugging plug-ins

The OpenOCD debugging **plug-ins are not included** in these packages, and need to be installed [as usual]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/install/). Just be sure that the **GNU MCU C/C++ OpenOCD Debugging** plug-ins are selected.

![Install the OpenOCD plug-ins]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/install-new-software-updates-openocd.png)

## Update OpenOCD path

Right after installing OpenOCD, or updating to a new version, it is necessary to inform Eclipse where the binaries were installed. If OpenOCD was installed in the default location, Eclipse has a mechanism to autodetect the most recent version, but this mechanism sometimes fails, and manual path setting is necessary.

To set the path, first exit Eclipse, and start it again, to allow the autodetect mechanism to give it a try.

- in the _Eclipse_ menu, go to **(Window →) Preferences** → **MCU** → **Global OpenOCD Path**

  ![OpenOCD preferences page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2018/preferences-mcu-openocd-path.png)

- click the **Restore Defaults** button

For more details please refer to the [OpenOCD plug-in]({{ site.baseurl }}/debug/openocd/#define-the-openocd-folder-location) page, where the entire procedure is explained.

## Documentation

If you are using the GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD, the documentation is part of the installed package.

Slightly older version are also available in the [Files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/files/openocd/) section of the SourceForge project. For version 0.9.0, the manual is [openocd.pdf](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/files/openocd/0.9.0/openocd.pdf/download).
