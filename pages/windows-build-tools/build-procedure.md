The GNU MCU Eclipse Windows Build Tools build scripts provide a single 
tool to create multi-platform binaries, generating the Windows 32 and 
Windows 64distribution packages.

The script was developed on macOS, but it also runs on any recent 
GNU/Linux distribution.

## How to build?

For the final authoritative details, please refer to the separate
