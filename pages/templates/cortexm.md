## Overview

The GNU MCU Eclipse Plug-ins provide template support for some of the most popular processor, but it is not reasonable to expect support for all existing ones. For the processors not supported by the specific templates, the GNU MCU Eclipse Plug-ins still provide a method to create projects, using the generic Cortex-M template.

## Requirements

The projects generated by the template are almost complete, except the device specific files, which must be provided by the user.

Before starting to use the generated projects, please identify the CMSIS vendor specific files. The required files are:

* the device CMSIS header (for example **stm32f4xx.h**)
* the device CMSIS system header (for example **system_stm32f4xx.h**)
* the device CMSIS system source file (for example **system_stm32f4xx.c**)
* the device specific interrupt vectors (for example **vectors_stm32f4xx.c**)

The first 3 files should be copied from the vendor specific package. Definitions of the interrupt vectors is usually done in an assembly file; it is recommended to identify the names of the vectors, and enter them in the .c vectors file.

## Create a new project

The template can create both C and C++ projects. To create a new C++ project:

* in the _Eclipse_ menu, go to **File** → **New → C++ Project**
* in the *Executables* group, select the **Hello ARM Cortex-M C/C++ Project**

![New Cortex-M project]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2014/04/NewCMProject.png)


Select the core type and various project settings:

![Define target core and project settings ]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2014/04/CMTarget.png)


All the above setting can be changes later, either in the project settings, or as different preprocessor definitions.

Define the names of the destination folders:

![Define destination folders names]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2014/04/CMFolders.png)

Instead of DEVICE, it is recommended to use the actual name suggested by the vendor, for example stm32f4-stdperiph.

Accept the default configuration names:

Define the toolchain name and path:

![Toolchain path]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2014/04/Toolchain.png)

The generated project has the following structure:

![Project structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2014/04/CMProject.png)

## Copy vendor specific files

In the generates project identify the **system/include/cmsis** and **system/src/cmsis** folder, and copy the vendor specific files to them:

* the device CMSIS header (for example **stm32f4xx.h**) should be copied to **system/include/cmsis** instead of DEVICE.h
* the device CMSIS system header (for example **system_stm32f4xx.h**) should be copied to **system/include/cmsis** instead of system_DEVICE.h
* the device CMSIS system source file (for example **system_stm32f4xx.c**) should be copied to **system/src/cmsis** instead of system_DEVICE.c
* the device specific interrupt vectors (for example **vectors_stm32f4xx.c**) should be copied to **system/src/cmsis** instead of vectors_DEVICE.c

## Check and correct the memory map

The defaults used for this generic project should be ok for most of the existing devices, but there might be cases when some devices have specific characteristics.

For this reason it is recommended to check the memory map generated in the **ldscripts/mem.ld** file, and possibly update the values that does not match your device, for example the flash origin, or the ram origin.

You can safely edit this file, since it will not be overwritten by the plug-in during future builds.

## Build

As seen in the above picture, even without the vendor specific files, the project builds without errors and, strangely enough, runs on the target, printing trace lines on the debugger output window, counting seconds.
