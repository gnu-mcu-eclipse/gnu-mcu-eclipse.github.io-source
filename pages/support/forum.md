## Goals

The forum goal was to facilitate experience sharing between
GNU MCU Eclipse users and as a place to post questions and support requests.
In case a problem is identified as bug or feature request, please use the
corresponding 
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/).

## Access

The forum URL is:

`https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/`

The forum type is open, and anyone can contribute. Access is free, 
based on registration.

## Groups

The GNU MCU Eclipse Group is one of the many groups available in the xPack
Forums. Scroll the window down and select the GNU MCU Eclipse group.

Under this group there are separate forums, for the build plug-ins, for the 
debug plug-ins, and for general discussions.

## Element14

The previous forum hosted on the 
[Element14](https://www.element14.com/community/groups/gnu-arm-eclipse) 
site is now decommissioned and
should no longer be used.
