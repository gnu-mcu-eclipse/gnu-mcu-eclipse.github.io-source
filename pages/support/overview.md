## Plug-ins issues

In case you encounter problems while using the plug-ins, please consider 
the following:

* read the documentation pages
* check the [Known issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/known-issues/)
* check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/)
* check the [GNU MCU Eclipse forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/forum/) for similar problems
* check the GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/)

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases,
if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have any
experience that you want to share with others, please use the
GNU MCU Eclipse [forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/forum/).

If you are convinced you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins,
please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/).

Follow the recommendations in the 
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and add a new ticket.

## Tools issues

Similarly, each tool project has a separate GitHub Issue tracker.

* [QEMU Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/issues/)
* [OpenOCD Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/issues/)
* [Windows Build Tools Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/issues/)

Please note that these trackers are mostly intended to the GNU MCU Eclipse
specifics of these tools (like packing, or specific changes), and for
issues affecting the core functionality, the user will most probably
be asked to refer to the tools trackers.

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos, wrong
phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them, you
can use the 
[Web Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io-source/issues/) tracker.

## Use of private e-mail

Please, please, please: **do not use private e-mail for support**; such
messages will be replied with a link to this page and the invitation
to use the project forum. The reason for this rude behaviour is simply
an attempt to use the time more efficiently; since the forum posts
are public and archived, there is a chance that other people having
similar problems will benefit from the answers.
