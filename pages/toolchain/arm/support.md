## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the ARM toolchain binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

___

The **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC** toolchain closely follows the official [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) maintained by ARM.

For functional issues (bug reports and new feature requests), please use the [Launchpad tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded).

For issues related to packing the GNU MCU Eclipse binaries, use the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/issues) page.
