## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the ARM toolchain binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.
