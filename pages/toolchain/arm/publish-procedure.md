## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the ARM toolchain binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

___

The ARM Embedded GCC binaries are published on GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases/).

The procedure used to publish those binaries is documented on the [PUBLISH](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/blob/xpack/README-PUBLISH.md) page in the same project.
