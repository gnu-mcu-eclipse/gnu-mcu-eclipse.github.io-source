## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the ARM toolchain binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new home page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

## Overview

The [**GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC**](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases/) is an alternate binary distribution that follows the official [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) maintained by ARM.

The build script is currently work in progress and the first releases are expected soon.
