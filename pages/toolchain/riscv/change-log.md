## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the RISC-V toolchain binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/](https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

The up-to-date change log was moved to the 
[build script project](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt).
