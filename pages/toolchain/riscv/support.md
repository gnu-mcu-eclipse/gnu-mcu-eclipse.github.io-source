## Deprecation notice

In mid-2019, the RISC-V toolchain binaries were moved from the GNU MCU Eclipse
project to the xPack project. The new page is:

* [https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/](https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/)

All previous releases are still available in the `@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope,
but were deprecated and are not recommended for new projects.

___

The **GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V Embedded GCC** toolchain closely follows the official [RISC-V distribution](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) maintained by [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com/).

For bug reports and new feature requests, please use the corresponding GitHub issues:

* the `riscv/riscv-gcc` project [issues](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/issues) page 
* the `riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb` project [issues](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb/issues) page
