## Overview

During the various install or update steps, it will be necessary to access
the binary files with the new releases.

There are two methods:

* **automatic** downloads, via the Eclipse update mechanism, to install
and update the Eclipse plug-ins
* **manual** downloads, to install various tools (like
OpenOCD/QEMU/Windows Build Tools/etc)

## Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++

The simplest way to install the plug-ins is to download
**Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers** from
[Eclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/downloads/)
and you get at once both Eclipse CDT and the Embedded CDT plug-ins.

## Eclipse Marketplace

The second option is to use the
[Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-embedded-cdt/).

To access the Marketplace from within Eclipse, use the Eclipse menu
**Help** â†’ **Eclipse marketplace...** and search for *Embedded CDT*.

## Eclipse update site

The Eclipse update site is currently hosted on Bintray, to make use
of the wide network of mirror sites they provides. The public URL is:

- `https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/updates/neon/`

## Embedded CDT Releases

Starting with **v5.1.1**, releases were published on the
[Eclipse servers](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/governance).

## Previous GNU MCU Eclipse Releases

All releases up to **v5.1.1** will continue to be available as
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/releases).

## Deprecated SourceForge files

The previous **Files** section in the **SourceForge** project is
now deprecated and will be preserved only for archiving purposes;
it will no longer be maintained and future releases will not be
published there.

It is highly recommended to use only the **Eclipse Marketplace**
for all downloads.
