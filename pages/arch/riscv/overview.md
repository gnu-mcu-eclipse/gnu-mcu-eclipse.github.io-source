## What is RISC-V?

![RISC-V logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2017/riscv-64x64.png){:class="right-align-image"}RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles.

![SiFive logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2017/sifive-logo-v1-64.png){:class="right-align-image"}RISC-V is governed by the non-profit RISC-V foundation and itâ€™s member companies after being originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley. SiFive, a significant contributor to the RISC-V foundation, manufactured the first commercially available RISC-V SoC, the Freedom E310.

## License

In contrast to most ISAs, the RISC-V ISA can be freely used for any purpose, permitting anyone to design, manufacture and sell RISC-V chips and software. The RISC-V authors aim to provide several CPU designs freely available under a [BSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license).

## Chips & boards

The GNU MCU Eclipse currently supports the following devices:

* SiFive Freedom E310, RV32IMAC, a 32-bit embedded processor
* SiFive E31 Coreplex, RV32IMAC, a Verilog synthesised 32-bit embedded processor
* SiFive E51 Coreplex, RV64IMAC, a a Verilog synthesised 64-bit embedded processor

The following boards are supported:

* SiFive HiFive1, an Arduino-compatible development kit featuring the Freedom E310
