Version 2.12 20190422 is a maintenance release of the GNU MCU Eclipse Windows Build Tools.

[Binary files Â»]({{ page.download_url }})

## Content

The GNU MCU Eclipse Build Tools v2.12 package includes the **version 4.2.1 of GNU make** (built from MSYS2 source files), and version **1.31.0-git of BusyBox**, which provides a convenient implementation for `sh`/`rm`/`echo`/`mkdir`.

## Changes

Both the make and BusyBox sources were upgraded to the latest available.

## Known problems

* none so far

## Binaries

Only binaries for **Windows** are provided.

They were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably 
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the 
[How to install the Windows Build Tools?]({{ site.baseurl }}/windows-build-tools/install/)
page.

The build tools are also available as an 
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools) 
and can be conveniently installed with 
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```console
$ xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers; 
all files required during builds are available as a separate 
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools)
project.
