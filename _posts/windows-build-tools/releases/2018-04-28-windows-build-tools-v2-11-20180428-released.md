## Content

The GNU MCU Eclipse Build Tools v2.11 package includes the **version 4.2.1 of GNU make** (built from MSYS2 source files), and version **1.29.0-git of BusyBox**, which provides a convenient implementation for `sh`/`rm`/`echo`/`mkdir`.

## Changes

Both the make and BusyBox sources were upgraded to the latest available.

## Known problems

* none so far

## Download

The new Windows Build Tools can be downloaded from the [GitHub Release]({{ page.download_url }}) page.

Separate archive files are provided for Windows 32/64-bit systems.

Note: by design, installing the xPack binaries does not require administrative rights, thus only portable archives are provided; Windows setups are no longer supported.
