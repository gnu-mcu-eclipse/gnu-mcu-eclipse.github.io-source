Version 4.7.2-202001271018 is a maintenance release; the main change is
the update to https for the CMSIS Packs index URL.

[Binary files Â»]({{ page.download_url }})

## Changes

* 69478ced - [#373] rework other redirects
* 4a6e7df8 - [#373] process redirects for index

* 97dd134b, 4a6e7df8 - [#373] in early January 2020, Keil/Arm relocated the
server storing the CMSIS Packs index to the cloud and
changed the URL to https, leaving a http redirect in the previous location.
Unfortunately the Java HttpURLConnection class used to download the
index does not handle redirections from http to https, and attempts to refresh
the index failed. The new URL was updated in the
C/C++ > MCU Packages > Reposiotries preferences page, and also redirection
was implementd in code.

## Known problems

* none

## Eclipse package

An Eclipse package will be created soon.
