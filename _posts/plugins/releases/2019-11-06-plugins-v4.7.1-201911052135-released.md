Version 4.6.1-201909231407 is a new release; the main changes are the
addition of support for
the new [xPack Dev Tools](https://xpack.github.io) and performance
fixes for the **CMSIS Packs** manager.

## The `@xpack-dev-tools` scope

* c424f652 - [Issue:[#351](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/351)]
in the initial implementation, the binary tools were grouped in the
`@gnu-mcu-eclipse` scope; since most of them were not related to Eclipse, they
were moved to a separate `@xpack-dev-tools` scope; the Eclipse plug-ins were
updated to support multiple xPack names and add the new names in the
`@xpack-dev-tools` scope were added to each plug-in.

The commands to install the new xPack are:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm@latest
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@latest
```

## Other new features

* 60359ef5 - [Issue:[#362](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/362)] Show version date in Packs View
* 69ec486e - [Issue:[#359](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/359)] Add support for TrustZone (`--mcmse`)

## Addressed bugs

* a90aeb0f - [Issue:[#335](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/335)] Retrieving the **package size** for some CMSIS packages (like Silicon Labs) failed due to the server sending the file in chunks and requiring a more complex processing; fixed.
* 7342e6d4 - [Issue:[#336](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/336)] In certain conditions, computing the cluster address in the **Peripheral registers** view failed since the increment was not identified properly fixed.
* e6de2688 - [Issue:[#347](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/347)] Due to a problem in CDT, using **libraries with spaces in names** failed the build; fixed, and the issue was reported to Eclipse maintainers ([551089](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=551089))
* 142eee35 - [Issue:[#341](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/341)] When initialising the CMSIS Packages plugin, if the location was changed from the default, the `Packages` folder was still created in the default location; fixed.
* 22bd0c77 - [Issue:[#346](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/346)] The size reserved for the xPack version was too small on GNU/Linux; fixed.
* 8410a731 - [Issue:[#343](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/343)] Due to a typo in SvdUtils, the 't' prefix (for tera) was not recognised; fixed.
* 0eff481e - [Issue:[#340](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/340)] In order to accept more legal content in the IP address field of the J-Link Debug plug-in, the validator was removed and any characters are now allowed.

## CMSIS Packs default location

* 4345cd17 - [Issue:[#357](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/357)]:
in the initial implementation, the default location of CMSIS Packs was
in the same folder as the workspace; when using multiple Eclipse
workspaces, in different locations, this resulted in multiple CMSIS Packs
folders; to avoid this, the default location of CMSIS Packs was changed
from the current workspace folder to a unique folder in the user folder.

The new location is platform dependent:

* macOS: `${HOME}/Library/CMSIS-Packs`
* Linux: `${HOME}/opt/cmsis-packs`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\CMSIS-Packs`

It is also possible to change these defaults by using the `CMSIS_PACKS_FOLDER`
environment variable.

The new default applies when installing new Eclipse environments; for
compatibility reasons, if an
existing environment contains a `Packages` folder in the same location as
the workspace, then it will be used as before.

## Other changes

* 2b053de3 - [Issue:[#338](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/338)] the list of accepted devices/architectures was (`-mcpu` & `-march`) was updated for GCC 8.x;
* 94409173 - [Issue:[#358](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/358)] the list of accepted compiler standards (`-std=`) was updated for GCC 9;
* 7ee535e6 - [Issue:[#360](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/360)] the **Refresh All** action in the Packs view was optimised and the pack size is retrieved only for the latest version;
* 903b4537 - [Issue:[#361](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/361)] the CMSIS Packs manager now accepts to install recent packages up to CMSIS Packs v1.6.0 specs;
* 69090d90 - [Issue:[#355](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/355)] given the change in processing ABI warnings in GCC, the project templates no longer pass `-Wabi` to the created projects.

## Eclipse packages

For convenience, this version of the plug-ins is also available as
an Eclipse package:

* [GNU MCU Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2019-09 20190923](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases/tag/v4.6.1-20190923-2019-09) which packs together the **2019-09** version (Eclipse 4.13) of the  **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** standard distribution with the **GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins**.

For historical reasons, packages using the previous Eclipses are also available:

* [GNU MCU Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2019-06 20190923](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases/tag/v4.6.1-20190923-2019-06) which packs together the **2019-06** version (Eclipse 4.12) of the  **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** standard distribution with the **GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins**;
* [GNU MCU Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2019-03 20190923](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases/tag/v4.6.1-20190923-2019-03) which packs together the **2019-03** version (Eclipse 4.11) of the  **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** standard distribution with the **GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins**;
