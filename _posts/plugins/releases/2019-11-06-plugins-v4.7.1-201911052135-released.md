Version 4.7.1-201911052135 is a maintenance release; the main change is an
enhancement in the logic to update the list of CMSIS Packs.

## Changes

* c2bc99ce - [#364] Given the design of the CMSIS Packs, updating
the list of known packs requires inspecting all packages, which is a
lengthy operation. To improve the user experience, the cache mechanism
was improved to also store the sizes of the inspected packages, making
subsequent updates significantly faster.

## Known problems

* none

## Eclipse package

For convenience, this version of the plug-ins is also available as
an Eclipse package:

* [GNU MCU Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2019-12 20190923](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases/tag/v4.7.1-20200115-2019-12)
which packs together the **2019-12** version (Eclipse 4.14) of the
**Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** standard distribution with the
**GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins**.
