## New features

* 13ffd0d3 - [Issue:[#322](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/322)]
  The `-std=c++17` option was added to the list of accepted C++ standards 
  in the build plug-ins.

## Addressed bugs

* 096806f5 - [Issue:[#323](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/323)] 
  based on a user report, it was discovered that the RISC-V compiler 
  options `-mplt -mdiv -mfdiv` must match the configuration used while 
  building the system libraries, and individually setting these options
  in user builds can create inconsistent applications; to minimise this
  risk, the options were removed from the graphical interface.
