Version 4.7.2-202001271244 is a maintenance release to fix the issue related
to the change introduced by the update to https for the CMSIS Pack index.

[Binary files Â»]({{ page.download_url }})

## Changes

* 97dd134b, 4a6e7df8 - [#373] in early January 2020, Keil/Arm relocated the
server storing the CMSIS Packs index to the cloud and
changed the URL to https, leaving a http redirect in the previous location.
The Java HttpURLConnection class used to download the
index does handle some redirections, but those from http to https are not
supported, and attempts to refresh
the index failed. The new URL was updated in the
C/C++ > MCU Packages > Reposiotries preferences page, and also redirection
was implementd in code.

## Known problems

* none

## Eclipse package

For convenience, this version of the plug-ins is also available as
an Eclipse package:

* [GNU MCU Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2019-12 20200127](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases/tag/v4.7.2-20200127-2019-12)
which packs together the **2019-12** version (Eclipse 4.14) of the
**Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** standard distribution with the
**GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins**.
