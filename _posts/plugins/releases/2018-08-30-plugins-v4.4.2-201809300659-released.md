## New features

* none

## Addressed bugs

* 3a7f1675 - [Issue:[#312](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/312)]
when de-selecting "Allocate console for GDB server" in the 
J-Link debugger options, the debug stops functioning properly;
the problem is quite complicated; until a proper solution will
be implemented, the temporary workaround was to disable the button.

## Template changes

* 41d23831 - [Issue:[#317](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/317)]
due to some changes in the newlib packed with GCC 7.3.x, 
the definition of the `_EXFUN` macro changed 
and the semihosting projects fail to build with a compile error in 
`system/src/newlib/_syscalls.c`; the undefined macro was no 
longer used.

## Other changes

* f7944003 - [Issue:[#315](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/315)]
the `resolveMacros()` function always displayed debug message on 
the console; the messages are now conditionally displayed.

## Known problems

* none
