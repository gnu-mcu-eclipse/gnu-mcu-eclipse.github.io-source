The GNU MCU Eclipse forum was relocated from the 
[Element14](https://www.element14.com/community/groups/gnu-arm-eclipse) site
to a dedicated section in the
[xPack forum](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/).

![GNU MCU Eclipse forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2019/forum-home.png)

## Access

The new URL is:

`https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/`

The forum type is open, and anyone can contribute. Access is free,
based on registration.

All those who appreciated the discussions on the old forum are invited
to register to the Tapatalk server and join the new forums.

## Element14

The previous forum hosted on the
[Element14](https://www.element14.com/community/groups/gnu-arm-eclipse) 
site is now decommissioned and
should no longer be used.

Unfortunately for now, the old content could not be migrated to the new
server.
